DPointNet performance and GPU setup
===================================

Start with a working example in :doc:`dpointnet_guide`. Performance depends on
network size, activity, batch, precision, inputs and outputs; there is no
universal speedup or memory requirement.

Use automatic acceleration
--------------------------

For ordinary use, leave ``rnn_cell_params.acceleration_profile`` omitted
or set it to ``"auto"``. The resolver selects compatible paths based on the
GPU, loaded operators, precision, batch and network structure.
It does not change your dynamics or lower precision to fit memory.

After building a model, inspect its choices:

.. code-block:: python

   rnn.build()
   print(rnn.precision_report)
   print(rnn.acceleration_report)

These reports explain requested/resolved settings; they do not prove that
every topology-specific kernel executed. Without compatible custom operators,
automatic selection retains supported TensorFlow paths. Explicit unsupported
kernel requests raise rather than silently switching implementations.
Explicit ``acceleration_profile=null`` disables profile expansion.

Do not copy a long list of flags from a different GPU or benchmark.
For Pascal hardware, read :doc:`dpointnet_pascal` before adopting a model.
A visible NVIDIA GPU alone does not establish compatibility with every
TensorFlow or DPointNet execution route.

Precision and memory
--------------------

The switches in :doc:`dpointnet_training_standards` control compute precision
and state/gradient accuracy. Full voltage sequences are optional and often
expensive; use :doc:`compact voltage regularization <dpointnet_training>`
when your objective permits it.

Batch size is an experimental choice, not an automatic speed setting.
Some implementations have specialized batch/basis requirements; other
shapes retain general paths. Measure initialization, representative activity
and optimizer updates with memory headroom, not just an idle model.
Changing condition layout can change the number and meaning of updates.

``use_device_poisson`` remains false by default. Its device sampler is still
Poisson, but changes seeded realizations. Treat enabling it as an input-policy
change and check replay, rather than assuming it is an identical speed switch.

FP32 derivatives across time
----------------------------

To check weak or long-lag learning signals under mixed precision, merge this
**JSON fragment** into a complete configuration:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "run": {
       "precision": {
         "mixed_precision": true,
         "fp32_voltage_and_asc": true,
         "fp32_temporal_gradients": true
       }
     }
   }

This uses FP32 derivatives across time while retaining the chosen forward
precision. It is not equivalent to a full FP32 simulation and does not widen
all synaptic forward state.

The supported temporal runner records projected synaptic currents so backward
replay uses the original forward trajectory. Omitted/null
``rnn_cell_params.current_replay_mode`` resolves to ``"record"`` for this
route. Explicit ``"recompute"`` saves that recording but repeats current
projection and is approximate when GPU reductions are nondeterministic.
Explicit replay modes require FP32 temporal gradients.

Recording requires approximately
``batch * neurons * steps * basis_count * bytes_per_current`` of host memory,
in addition to the model. For FP16 currents, ``bytes_per_current=2``.
Chunked replay reduces per-transfer size, not this total recording.
Measure host RAM, GPU memory and transfer costs on your model.

FP32 temporal gradients require selective state and a supported
``TemporalAdjointRunner`` or ``ExplicitStateRNN``. A direct cell tape or a
custom loop does not become FP32-temporal just by setting the option.
Do not force FP16 packed backward kernels, nest another gradient-replay
runner around it, or assume independent GPU forwards become bitwise equal.
Masked, time-major, backwards, stateful and explicitly unrolled execution
are unsupported by this route. Custom-runner details are in
:doc:`dpointnet_development`.

Build optional CUDA operators
-----------------------------

Skip this section for the CPU first-run example. For custom GPU acceleration,
build in the same environment used to execute BMTK. You need GPU-enabled
TensorFlow, a CUDA toolkit containing ``nvcc`` and a compatible C++17 compiler.
The toolkit/compiler must match TensorFlow's build requirements; installing
TensorFlow's runtime CUDA packages alone does not supply the full build setup.

From the intended checkout:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c 'import bmtk; print(bmtk.__file__)'
   nvcc --list-gpu-code
   python -m bmtk.simulator.dpointnet.custom_ops.build

The build produces both ``_csr_spike_ops.so`` (synaptic-current operations)
and ``_glif_state_ops.so`` (neuron-state operations). Inspect their
``.archs`` manifests to check which GPU architectures were included.
Use the current checkout, not an unrelated installed BMTK.

For a shared installation spanning Pascal through Hopper, explicitly build
a **fat binary**: one operator library containing code for multiple GPU
architectures. This is a deployment option, not a first-run requirement:

.. code-block:: bash

   DPOINTNET_CUDA_ARCHS="61 70 75 80 86 89 90" \
     python -m bmtk.simulator.dpointnet.custom_ops.build

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Compute capability
     - Example hardware
   * - 6.1
     - GTX1080Ti / Titan Xp
   * - 7.0
     - V100
   * - 7.5
     - Quadro RTX8000
   * - 8.0
     - A100
   * - 8.6
     - RTX3090
   * - 8.9
     - L40S
   * - 9.0
     - H200

Keep targets ascending and space-separated. The final target also gets PTX,
an intermediate GPU code format (PTX90 for this list).
Pascal 6.1 requires an explicit target; it is not in the implicit build list.
If the compiler cannot cover your intended devices, use a compatible toolchain
or separate declared builds; do not silently omit a required device.

These libraries are reusable across included GPUs only with compatible
TensorFlow/CUDA binary interfaces. Rebuild after CUDA source, signature or
binary-interface changes. Do not replace a library in use by another process.
On clusters, follow the site's rules for compilation and compute allocations.

.. warning::

   A successful multi-architecture build is not a test of every device.
   Check the actual model, inputs, precision, updates, restoration and memory
   on each new GPU family. General NEST/Pascal and physical multi-GPU execution
   are not established by the build.

Measure an improvement
----------------------

Compare the same hardware, inputs, activity, precision, losses, update protocol
and output mode. Exclude tracing/compilation and warm up before timing.
For repeatable measurements, use at least three warmups and twenty synchronized
samples, and report variation as well as a median.

Separate input generation, the model update, validation and result writing.
TensorFlow allocation differs from driver memory reservations; neither is a
standalone fragmentation measure. See the training callback's memory reports.
Default launchers use TensorFlow's BFC memory allocator; importing BMTK does
not override an application's allocator environment.
