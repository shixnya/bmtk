DPointNet
#########

DPointNet simulates spiking neuronal networks in TensorFlow and can train their
synaptic weights against a chosen objective. It reads network files in SONATA,
the same format used by other BMTK simulators. You can use it for simulation
without training, or for learning in a recurrent network.

The supported neuron model is **GLIF3**: a generalized leaky integrate-and-fire
model with two after-spike currents (ASC), which describe adaptation after a
spike. The Python class is named ``GLIF3Cell``. One instance represents the
network's neuron population, not a single biological neuron.

During training, a smooth **surrogate derivative** replaces the derivative of
the spike threshold. **Backpropagation through time** (BPTT) then assigns later
errors to earlier network activity. The chosen loss functions define which
observables the network is trained to fit.

For the scientific background, see
`Ito et al., 2026 <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.03.13.711751v1>`_.
Use documentation from the same BMTK revision as your installation.

Installation
============

Follow :doc:`installation` for BMTK's base dependencies. DPointNet additionally
requires TensorFlow. The CPU walkthrough below was checked with Python 3.13
and TensorFlow 2.21; TensorFlow 2.13 with Python 3.8 is also covered by
compatibility tests. These are tested combinations, not an exhaustive support
matrix.

From a BMTK source checkout, in an activated environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install -e .
   python -m pip install "tensorflow==2.21.0"

For a Linux NVIDIA GPU setup, TensorFlow's CUDA dependencies can instead be
installed with ``python -m pip install 'tensorflow[and-cuda]==2.21.0'``.
Check the driver and platform requirements in the
`TensorFlow installation guide <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip>`_.

**Custom CUDA operators are optional for the first example.** Without them,
automatic acceleration uses compatible TensorFlow paths. Building the operators
also requires a CUDA toolkit with ``nvcc`` and a compatible C++ compiler; that
is a separate step in :doc:`dpointnet_performance`.

Run a small simulation
======================

The source checkout includes a complete 300-neuron example in
``examples/dpointnet_all2all``: 200 excitatory neurons, 100 inhibitory neurons,
100 virtual input nodes, component files and a prebuilt SONATA network.
There is no network download or build step.

Copy that directory to a writable work area so results do not modify the
original example. On Linux or macOS, from the checkout root:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p "$HOME/bmtk-examples"
   cp -R examples/dpointnet_all2all "$HOME/bmtk-examples/"
   cd "$HOME/bmtk-examples/dpointnet_all2all"
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python run_dpointnet.py config.inference.json

This runs 500 steps at 1 ms per step, with batch size one, on the CPU. The
example explicitly uses FP32 and legacy dynamics to preserve its original
behavior; those settings are not the omitted defaults for a new GLIF model.
Its random input uses a Bernoulli spike generator, not a Poisson generator.

The script displays a spike raster and writes ``output/spikes.h5``,
``output/voltages.h5`` and ``output/log.txt``. Successful completion is reported
as ``RNN.run() completed.`` The raster is an activity check, not evidence that
the network reproduces a biological target. This small example needs no GPU;
its resource use is not an estimate for a cortex-scale network.

On a headless machine, set ``MPLBACKEND=Agg`` before running the command. To
save a plot instead of displaying one, use the same configuration from Python:

.. code-block:: python

   from bmtk.simulator import dpointnet

   config = dpointnet.Config.from_json("config.inference.json")
   config.build_env()
   rnn = dpointnet.RNN.from_config(config)
   results = rnn.run()
   results.spikes.raster(batch_nums=0, show=False)

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   plt.savefig("raster.png")
   rnn.cleanup()

Keep the example directory as the working directory: its file paths are
relative to that location. ``config.build_env()`` prepares output directories
and logging. ``RNN.from_config()`` loads the network and execution settings;
``run()`` builds the model, trains it if configured, then runs and saves the
configured inference.

Understand the configuration
============================

Start by editing a complete example, rather than assembling an incomplete
fragment. The important top-level fields are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - JSON location
     - Purpose
   * - ``manifest``
     - Path variables such as ``$NETWORK_DIR`` and ``$OUTPUT_DIR``.
   * - ``run``
     - ``dt`` in milliseconds, ``seq_len`` in steps, batch size, seed and precision.
   * - ``rnn_cell_params``
     - ``cell_model: "GLIF3Cell"``, neuron dynamics, learning derivatives and acceleration.
   * - ``components`` and ``networks``
     - Model-component directories and SONATA node/edge files.
   * - ``inputs``
     - Named input generators for virtual input populations.
   * - ``initial_state``
     - Optional shared initial-state generator.
   * - ``training``
     - Training duration, optimizer, learning rate, conditions, losses and callbacks.
   * - ``inference``
     - Input names and initial state for simulation; may also specify its own output.
   * - ``output``
     - Default result directory, logging, spike and voltage filenames.

For example, ``seq_len=500`` and ``dt=1.0`` describe 500 ms. A batch contains
multiple input trials processed together; it does not extend the time window.
Choose both explicitly for your experiment.

The following is a **JSON fragment**, to merge into a complete configuration:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "run": {
       "seq_len": 500,
       "dt": 1.0,
       "batch_size": 1,
       "default_seed": 3000,
       "precision": {
         "mixed_precision": false
       }
     },
     "rnn_cell_params": {
       "cell_model": "GLIF3Cell"
     }
   }

Here FP32 is selected explicitly for a simple CPU starting point. For GPU
training, :doc:`dpointnet_training_standards` explains the mixed-precision
defaults and the switches for wider state and gradients.

Use ``inference.initial_state`` or ``training.initial_state`` for a
stage-specific state generator. ``{"module": "zero_state"}`` starts from zero;
``from_input`` uses a preparatory input rollout. Do not substitute one policy
for another when comparing experiments.

Import your own network
-----------------------

Use the :doc:`BMTK Network Builder <builder>` or existing SONATA files.
Recurrent neurons need GLIF component JSONs, while edge types identify their
synaptic dynamics and weights. Virtual input populations also need their
edges into the recurrent population.

The example's ``components`` and ``networks`` sections show the complete file
layout. For raw synaptic kinetics without precomputed basis coefficients, see
:doc:`dpointnet_alpha_basis`. For visual input generated by a lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN) model, see :doc:`dpointnet_lgn_pipeline`.

Train the example
=================

For this small legacy example, disable activation checkpointing explicitly.
Its integer refractory initial state is incompatible with the checkpointed
legacy loop in this revision. This is an example-specific limitation, not a
change to the general checkpointing default, and does not disable BPTT.

From the same example directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python - <<'PY'
   from bmtk.simulator import dpointnet

   config = dpointnet.Config.from_json("config.train.all.json")
   config["training"]["gradient_checkpointing"] = False
   config.build_env()
   rnn = dpointnet.RNN.from_config(config)
   rnn.run()
   rnn.cleanup()
   PY

This complete configuration runs two epochs of three steps each, fits a
synthetic 15-Hz target for all neurons, and then runs inference.
The default callbacks write ``callbacks_outputs/losses.csv`` and export
trained edge files under ``callbacks_outputs/trained_weights/``.
This is a workflow demonstration, not a
recommended learning rate or biological target for another network.

Continue with :doc:`dpointnet_training` for ordinary training choices,
validation, saved weights and optional regularizers. For your own objectives
or training hooks, follow :doc:`dpointnet_custom_training`; no BMTK edits are needed.

Dynamics and simulation
=======================

Omitting ``rnn_cell_params.dynamics_mode`` selects ``"nest"``, DPointNet's
**NEST-compatible dynamics**. This implements NEST-compatible timing,
adaptation and delay handling in TensorFlow; it does **not** run the NEST
simulator or require a NEST installation. The mode supports both training
and simulation.

Explicit ``"legacy"`` remains available
for reproducing an older model. Changing dynamics changes the simulated
trajectory; it is not just a speed setting.

Training uses a **soft reset**, subtracting the spike-reset amount rather than
forcing voltage to the reset value. Explicit ``hard_reset=true`` is rejected
for training. Simulation of learned weights should retain the training
reset policy. To study hard-reset dynamics, build a separate inference-only
model with that setting and assess the changed behavior.

NEST-compatible mode timestamps spikes at the end of the timestep. Its ``dt`` must be a
positive multiple of 0.001 ms, and external delays must be at least one step.
Compatibility describes the implemented dynamics; numerical precision and
fitted synaptic waveforms can still produce differences from a NEST simulation.

For simulation only, omit ``training`` and retain ``inference``. For manual
execution, use ``rnn.build()``, ``rnn.train()`` and ``rnn.run_inference()``;
unlike ``run()``, ``run_inference()`` returns results without automatically
saving them. Long simulations need complete state, delay history and random
stream handling between chunks; repeated independent calls are not an
automatic continuous simulation.
